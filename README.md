This is the course project for DIP which recurrents the paper " Deep Multi-Model Fusion for Single-Image Dehazing" and use the public code by the author. 
Meanwhile I just modified a little to do data enhancing which aims to improve the performance of the model in the dark environment. I choose the preprocess_Ohaze_data.py
to do this which add dark copies of the data itself to simulate a relatively daek environment.
